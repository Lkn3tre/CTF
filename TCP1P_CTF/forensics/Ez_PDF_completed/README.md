* *1. Use `ExifTool`,notice a base64 chunk. When decoded, you will get this message: "In this question, the flag has been divided into 3 parts. You have found the first part of the flag!! TCP1P{D01n9_F023n51C5"*
* *2. Extract all the images in the PDF with `mutool`. One of them contains the second part: _ON_pdf_f1L35_15_345y (u can also use PDF editor to move the logo so you can see the image behind it )*
* *3. When performing a `strings` operation, notice a JavaScript code obfuscates (u can also use the pdf-parser tool to extract the js code because its actually an object). After understanding what it does, it takes three elements "a, b, c" from the list "_0x3c1521", concatenates them in a certain order, and puts them in "console.log()". That give the third part of the flag: _15N7_17_l3jaf9ci293m1d}*

**Flag: TCP1P{D01n9_F023n51C5_0N_pdf_f1L35_15_345y_15N7_17_l3jaf9ci293m1d}**
